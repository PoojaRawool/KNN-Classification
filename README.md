Refer the KNeighborsClassiferdocumentation https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html<br>
Understand the implementation of the same.<br>
1)Load the dataset<br>
2) Perform EDA (Do not use Standardization at this stage).<br>
3) Use KNeighborsClassifierto classify the UCI wilt dataset.<br>
4) Tune ‘K’ to find the ideal value of this hyperparameter 
Do you think the results may be different with scaling? <br>
5) Perform data scaling. Repeat steps 3 and 4. <br>
